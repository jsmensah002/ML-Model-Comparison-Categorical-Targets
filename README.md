Project Goal: 
-Compare the performance of three machine learning models—Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest Classifier (RF) for predicting categorical outcomes. The dataset used focuses on customer churn prediction.

Method: 
- Built and trained three separate models (LR, SVM, RF) to predict customer churn.
- Compared model performance using relevant metrics, highlighting accuracy, stability, and suitability for the dataset. 

Logistic Regression Results (with a balanced class weight):
- R^2 (full dataset) = 0.7147
- R^2 (Trained 80% of the dataset) = 0.7142
- R^2 (Tested 20% of the dataset) = 0.7165
- Churn prediction = 0

Support Vector Machine Results:
- R^2 (full dataset) = 0.7963
- R^2 (Trained 80% of the dataset) = 0.7945
- R^2 (Tested 20% of the dataset) = 0.8035
- Churn prediction = 0

Random Forest Results:
- R^2 (full dataset) = 0.9569
- R^2 (Trained 80% of the dataset) = 0.9957
- R^2 (Tested 20% of the dataset) = 0.8010
- Churn prediction = 1
